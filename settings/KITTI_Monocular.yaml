# optimization

# chi-square is a evaluation criteria. Chi-square is defined as the sum of 
# squares of n variables that follow the normal distribution. Therefore, 
# assuming that the error follows the normal distribution, it follows 
# this distribution. This distribution shows a different distribution 
# depending on the degree of freedom of the independent variable. 
# The larger the degree of freedom, the closer it is to 
# the normal distribution, and the smaller the degree of freedom, 
# the more biased it is. In the case of a monocular image, since it has two 
# independent variables, x and y, the degree of freedom is 2, of which 
# the confidence interval is 95% and the value corresponding to p=0.05 is used.
